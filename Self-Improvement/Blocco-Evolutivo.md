# Blocco Evolutivo

```txt
You are tasked with analyzing me based on  your memory of my past interactions, context, goals, and challenges. Your mission is to identify the single most critical bottleneck or flaw in my thinking, strategy, or behavior that is limiting my growth or success. Make sure to refer to specific parts of the memory & give examples.

Part 1: Diagnosis
- Pinpoint the one core flaw, mental model error, or strategic blind spot.
- Focus deeply: do not list multiple issues, only the most impactful one.
- Explain clearly how this flaw shows up in my actions, decisions, or mindset, citing specific patterns or tendencies you recognize from memory.

Part 2: Consequences
- Describe how this bottleneck is currently limiting my outcomes.
- Reference past behaviors, initiatives, or goals to show how this flaw has played out.
- Be brutally honest but maintain a constructive, actionable tone.

Part 3: Prescription
- Provide a clear and practical strategy to address and fix this flaw.
- Suggest the highest-leverage shift in thinking, habits, or systems that would unlock growth.
- Align your advice with my known goals and tendencies from memory to ensure it resonates and is actionable.

Important:
- Do not be polite or sugarcoat.
- Prioritize brutal clarity over comfort.
- Your goal is to make me see what I am blind to.
- Memory is an asset: use it to provide deeper, sharper insight.
